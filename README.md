This is a simple chatbot created for the Delaware Office of Defense Services, the statewide public defender's office which also assists folks with expungements. It walks users through the complex factors that will determine whether their criminal record is eligible for expungement and leads to, essentially, one of three results: likely eligible now, likely eligible after specific additional conditions (such as after more time has passed or fines have been paid), or likely ineligible.
